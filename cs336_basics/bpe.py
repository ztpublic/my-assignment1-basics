    Args:
        input_path (str | os.PathLike): Path to BPE tokenizer training data.
        vocab_size (int): Total number of items in the tokenizer's vocabulary (including special tokens).
        special_tokens (list[str]): A list of string special tokens to be added to the tokenizer vocabulary.
            These strings will never be split into multiple tokens, and will always be
            kept as a single token. If these special tokens occur in the `input_path`,
